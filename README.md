# Medicare-Outpatient-Cost-Profitability-Analysis

This project analyzes Medicare outpatient hospital data to uncover cost and utilization patterns, identify geographic disparities, and evaluate provider billing efficiency. Using SQL and Tableau, the analysis aims to highlight strategic recommendations to reduce healthcare costs and improve transparency.

I have divided the project into 3 broad pillars :

##Pillar 1: Cost & Utilization Patterns
Main Questions:
1.	What are the top 10 most frequently billed outpatient procedures in the U.S.?
2.	Which procedures have the highest submitted charges on average?
3.	Are there specific hospitals consistently charging more than others for the same procedure?
4.	How does utilization (volume of services) differ across procedure types?
Why it matters: Helps uncover high-cost, high-volume drivers in the system.

##Pillar 2: Geographic Disparities
Main Questions:
5. How do average procedure costs differ by state or region?
6. Are there any states consistently showing higher charge-to-payment ratios?
7. Can we identify outlier providers within each state based on submitted charges?
Why it matters: Spotting regional cost inefficiencies can support policy or provider strategy.

##Pillar 3: Efficiency & Reimbursement Analysis
Main Questions:
8. What is the average difference between submitted charges and Medicare-allowed payments?
9. Which procedures or providers have the largest variance in this difference?
10. Are there trends that suggest inefficient billing practices or possible overbilling?
Why it matters: Understanding margins between billed and paid can help reduce waste and fraud.
